# Introduction #

For most [GWT](http://code.google.com/webtoolkit/) applications is a natural requirement to use the same model objects on both the server and the client side. For example when executing a HQL query using [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/), the simplest solution would be to return the query result to the GWT application as it is, without any transformation or change.

Unfortunatelly this is not possible because GWT uses [JRE emulation](http://code.google.com/intl/hu-HU/webtoolkit/doc/1.6/RefJreEmulation.html), which supports only a subset of the Java types available on the server side. Moreover Hibernate often returns special objects, for example:
  * runtime proxies in case of lazy references (generated by Javassist or CGLIB)
  * special [persistent collection implementations](https://www.hibernate.org/hib_docs/v3/api/org/hibernate/collection/PersistentCollection.html)
None of these are supported by GWT, therefore some kind of transformation is required between the client and server side.

This library performs the required transformations, making Hibernate entities available to GWT applications as easily as possible.
